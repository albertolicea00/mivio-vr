## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Mivio (such as credentials handling, network exposure in SMB/WebDAV scanning, or local sandbox bypasses), **please do not open a public issue.** Instead, report it privately so we can investigate and patch the issue responsibly.

### How to Report
Please send an email to Alberto Licea at **albertolicea00@gmail.com** (or the respective maintainer email) with:
1. A descriptive title outlining the vulnerability.
2. A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
3. Steps to reproduce the issue (including a Proof of Concept if possible).
4. Details of the system configuration you tested (e.g. Meta Quest 3, Pico 4).

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and strive to provide a resolution or patch within **30 days**.

## Secure Practices in Mivio
To maintain the highest standard of security for media servers:
- **Keychain Storage:** We store sensitive connection data, such as SMB passwords and WebDAV bearer tokens, securely in the secure encrypted storage using our custom storage adapters. We never persist raw credentials to database models or user defaults.
- **App Sandboxing:** All platform targets (iOS, tvOS, visionOS, and macOS App Store builds) run in full compliance with platform-specific sandbox rules.
- **Local Network Usage:** Network protocols such as SMB (AMSMB2/libsmb2) and WebDAV use sandboxed client wrappers and explicitly ask for Local Network permissions.
